## CDNJS

Help me get this hosted on CDNJS by giving the repository a `star`. I require at least 800 stars to submit to CDNJS.

## Installation and Usage

### Adding the script tag to the HEAD

```html
    <!-- Place script tag before the end of the head tag -->
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/dev-social-badge@0.1.0/dist/dev-social-badge.min.js"></script>
```

### Adding the devbadge and script tags to the BODY
_If you're using a template for your blog posts, I suggest adding this to the template file for your blog posts - not your main site layout._ This will help to reduce unnecessary API calls to [DEV.to](https://dev.to/).

```html
    <!-- Place devbadge tag wherever you'd like the badge to appear -->
    <devbadge />
    <!-- Place script tag before the end of the body tag -->
    <script>window.onload = function(){typeof findOnDev !== "undefined" && findOnDev()}</script>
```
